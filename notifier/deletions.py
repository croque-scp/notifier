"""Handles deletions.

Handles deletions of posts and threads from the database that appear to
have been deleted on the remote (but actually just flags them to be
ignored).

Also handles the purging of invalid user config pages from the
configuration wiki. An invalid user config page is any page where the slug
does not match the user who created it. This indicates that the page has
not been properly created, and may even be indicative of malicious intent.
In lieu of manual moderation these pages should be cleared.
